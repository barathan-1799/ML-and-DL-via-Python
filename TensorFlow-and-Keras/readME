This folder contains Python notebooks that demonstrate different types of Deep Learning models that were built using TensorFlow and Keras:
- Model 1: This program contains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that was built from-scratch using Keras to be trained on CIFAR-10 image dataset.
- Model 2: This program contains a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that was built from-scratch using Keras to be trained on IMDB sequence dataset.
- Model 3: This program contains a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) that was built from-scratch using Keras to be trained on MNIST images dataset.
- Model 4: This program contains an Autoencoder (AE) that was built from-scratch using Keras to be trained on MNIST images dataset.
- Model 5: This program contains a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) that was built from-scratch using Keras to be trained on MNIST images dataset.
- Model 6: This program contains a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) that was built from-scratch using Keras to be trained on MNIST images dataset.
- Model 7: This program contains a Deep Q-Network (DQN) that was built from-scratch using Keras to be trained for CartPoleâ€‘v1 environment.
